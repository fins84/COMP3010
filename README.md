# COMP3010
Curtin Uni Machine Learning Assignment.

Completed 2023 Semester 1.

Only uploading my code and results. The assignment document itself will not be uploaded.

## Content
Section 1 is contained in the report, its just notes required in the assignment.

Section 2 task is to train a residual network for image classification on the FashionMNIST Dataset. 

Section 3 task was to train a residual network for image classification on the CIFAR-10 Dataset.

The report contains my step-by-step process on how I optimised my residual model. It also contains all supplementary references used for the initial resnet model and optimisation techniques.

**Both Section 2 and 3 required a balance of performance, accuracy and training time**
